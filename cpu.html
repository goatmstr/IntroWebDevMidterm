        The CPU or Central Processing Unit is perhaps the most important
        component in a PC. It is a necessary component of every single PC as it
        is what controls and processes every single thing the computer does. In
        a sense, the CPU is the computer itself. Without the CPU, the PC is
        simply an assortment of parts connected together that does nothing. In
        the scope of a gaming PC, the CPU is crucial in calculating the millions
        of calculations and instructions that needs to be done every second the
        game is running. Every little interaction, every bit of physics and game
        mechanics is quickly calculated by the many cores in the powerhouse that
        is the CPU. Generally, the most powerful and expensive CPUs on the
        market is overkill for gaming as those are used for heavy tasks done by
        workstations. Right now, the market is dominated by Intel's and AMD
        Ryzen's Processors when it comes to PC GPUs. Choosing between Intel and
        AMD is a question many PC enthusiasts debate about. But when it comes to
        price vs gaming performance, many would choose AMD over Intel as of
        2024, specifically with the Ryzen 7 7800X3D which would be my personal
        recommendation.
