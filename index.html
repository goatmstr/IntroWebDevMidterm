        So about a year ago, I picked up a new very interesting but also
        expensive hobby that is PC building. Having played games mostly on
        consoles before, I had heard about the greatly increased capabilities
        that a gaming PC can bring compared to a console. However, this also
        meant that a gaming PC would cost way more than a console too which is
        what stops many people from getting into PC gaming. Now if the cost
        isn't a big issue, yet another hurdle is actually getting your hands on
        a gaming PC. Sure you could go to your nearest BestBuy and pick up a
        decent prebuilt and be done with it but doing that always costs way more
        than assembling your own parts and building a pc yourself. Plus,
        building your own PC is more rewarding and can often be a hobby in of
        itself. This guide is the first part in a series of guides aiming to
        help newcomers build their very first PC. People are often overwhelmed
        by the amount of parts that go into building a pc such as what each part
        does and which brands they should go for. Wisely picking out all the
        parts is a large portion of the work that needs to be done when building
        a PC and that is what this guide will help with. Part 2 will go indepth
        into actually building the PC so stay tuned!
